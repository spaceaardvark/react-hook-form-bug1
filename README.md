A reproduction for https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues.

1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run serve`
4. Navigate to `localhost:8080`.
5. Open the JavaScript console to see the error, "process is not defined".

You can "fix" the bug by uncommenting line #7 in `src/main.js`.
